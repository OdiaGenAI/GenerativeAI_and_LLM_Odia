## About
The Odia Generative AI (in short, OdiaGen) is an initiative to research Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) for the low-resource Odia language.

## Why OdiaGen

* **First**: though many LLMs support multilingual including Odia language, the performance for various tasks (e.g. content generation, question-answering) is limited due to ingested data for Odia. 

* **Second**: there is subscription or fees associated with the high-performing LLMs.

* **Third**: the usage of data input to these LLMs is in question.
