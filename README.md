## About
The Odia Generative AI (in short, OdiaGen) is an initiative to research Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) for the low-resource Odia language.

## Objective
The OdiaGen aims to i) build pre-trained Odia LLM, ii) fine-tuned Odia LLM, and iii) instruct LLM (Odia). The data, code, and models will be available to the public for research and non-commercial purposes.  

## Why OdiaGen

* **First**: though many LLMs support multilingual including Odia language, the performance for various tasks (e.g. content generation, question-answering) is limited due to the amount of ingested data for Odia. 
* **Second**: there is subscription or fees associated with the high-performing LLMs.

* **Third**: the usage (privacy) of data input to these LLMs is in question.

## What are the focus research areas of OdiaGen
The major focus areas are divided into three tasks.

*  **WP1_Literature Survey:** Investigate the latest developments in Generative AI and LLMs and analyze recent methods to support Odia language for different tasks. 
*  **WP2_Development:** Developing pre-trained and fine-tuned Odia LLM which includes dataset preparation, model training, evaluation, prompt engineering, and API development. 
*  **WP3_Deployment:** Deploy the models for public access for research and non-commercial purposes.

## Who can use these models
The models (pre-trained/fine-tuned) will be available through Hugging Face for research and mon-commercial purposes. For domain specific application or particular use cases feel free to contact.
